- 👋 Hi, I’m @BlacKaiju
      I used to work in entertainment making live events, theater, some tv/film. COVID-19 has forced me to change careers and I'm more than okay with that!!
      My passions definitely lie elsewhere and I'm discovering that tech is something I'm extremely interested in!
      
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much as I can and how to make eCommerce shopping carts and web-based games!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript and React through personal projects and FreeCodeCamp

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me further my knowledge of this new world

- 📫 How to reach me: Email is the best way to reach me.
